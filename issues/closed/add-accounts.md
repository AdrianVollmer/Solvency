Above "Categories" in the menu bar, add a new menu item called
"Accounts".

On the Accounts page, present all present accounts in form of cards to
the user. Clicking on an account takes the user to a form, where they
can edit the account. The form should also have a "Delete" button.

Accounts can have a name and a type ("Cash" or "Securities"). The
database ID should also be shown to the user, because they need this for
importing data.

Expenses can be associated with an optional account of type "Cash".
Trading Activities can be associated with an optional account of type
"Securities".

For importing, we need to add an optional field for the account. It can
contain the database ID of an account.

For now, let's ignore the account in all analytics or the net worth
page. Let's consider it a completely optional feature for now.
