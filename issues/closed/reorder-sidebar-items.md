Let's reorder the items in the sidebar. It should look like this:

    Dashboard

    -------------

    Analytics

     - Spending
     - Posititions
     - Net worth

    --------------

    Manage

     - Accounts
     - Expenses
     - Activities
     - Categories
     - Tags
     - Rules
     - Import

    --------------

    Settings

The new "Spending" page should be what is currently the "Analytics"
page.

The new "Import" page should unify both expenses and activities. Just
show both forms using tabs. The user can choose what to upload.
