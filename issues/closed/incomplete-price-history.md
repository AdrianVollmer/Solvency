When viewing a position in detail, and we don't have historical market data for
that position, we can still show the price history using the approximated value.
We know the value based on the last buy/sell. It will look like a step function,
but that's better than nothing, which we see currently.

Same with the quantitites "current value". We can show it in yellow with a
question mark, like in the table of all positions.
