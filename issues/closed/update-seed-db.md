The `seed-db.py` script needs updating.

It should generate three years worth of expenses and trading activities.
It should create several accounts. We should also see a salary with yearly
raises and some varations (random bonus, some deductions, etc).
It should show case most features of the app. It will be used to generate a
Docker image containing this demo data.
