In the sidebar, split up the "Manage" section into two:

- Data
  - Accounts
  - Transactions
  - Activities
  - Market Data
  - Bulk Import (moved and renamed from "Import")
- Manage
  - Categories
  - Tags
  - Rules

Rename "Analytics" to "Insights"

On mobile, the top-level items should be collapsed. Users must tap to expand and
see the subitems.
