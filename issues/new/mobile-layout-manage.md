In "Manage" on a mobile device, the export/import buttons are collapsed into a
three-dot dropdown button. When clicking, the dropdown menu appears to the left
and is mostly off-screen.

We had this before in "Transactions". Use askama macros to harmonize this.

Also, in "Spending", the buttons "By Category", "Monthly", etc. should shrink
into just icons without labels on mobile.
